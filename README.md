This codebase is designed to supplement the instruction of ASPEN Plus Software.
ASPEN Plus, while a very powerful tool in chemical process simulations, has a reputation for being outdated, prone to crashing, and unhelpful when user-entered inputs do not produce a valid design.
These Examples show why different parameters are not feasible, and can provide students learning ASPEN with a direction for which values to change after a simulation failed to converge.
